# UnWined
======

UnWined is a user-data driven social app built on top of multiple Google Map APIs, with an AngularJS front-end and a Firebase database. On page load, a map is initialized with Nashville Software School at its center (500 Interstate Boulevard S). Once intitialized, the map is populated with markers for any bars users have taged as having specials. Clicking one of the markers opens an info window with any stored specials at the location. Clicking the more info button in the info window populates the sidebar with more information about the bar, a picture (or the ability to add one if a picture hasn't been added yet), and an edit specials button that allows users to add and update specials. Can't find your favorite bar and want to add its specials? Click the Find Bars link, search for any location using the Google Autocomplete enable text input field, and the map will mark all bars in a 2000 meter radius around the specified location. Clicking a marker opens an info window with a button that will add the location to the Specials map to be edited.
